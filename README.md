<b><i>Estimation of COVID-19 trajectories </i></b> is to estimate COVID-19 cumulative trajectories using data integration. This project follows a paper <b><i>'Estimation of COVID-19 spread curves integrating global data and borrowing information'</i></b>(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236860) written by Se Yoon Lee, Bowen Lei and Bani Mallick. This paper deals with efficiency and excellences of using data integration in estimating cumulatives of pandemic, that is COVID-19. 



<h2> Goals </h2>

- Understand overall structure of Bayesian model
- Comprehend property of shirnkage priors, especially **Horseshoe prior**
- Learn a number of sampling methods to estimate posterior distributions of BHRM parameters, especially **Slice Sampling and Elliptical Slice Sampling (ESS) **
- Implement Slice Sampling and ESS in **R and matlab**
- Fit model in **R, Stan and JAGs**
- Visualize fitted values of cumulative trajectories in R
- Predict expected numbers of infections in each country
